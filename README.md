# imped2drt
Code to transform impedance data from frequency domain to time domain by calculating the distribution of relaxation times based on Elastic Net regularization (modelled after code from: Electrochimica Acta **313**, 570 (2019)).  

Data must be in the form of frequency, Z', Z" or frequency, Y', Y". 

More features to come soon!
